This folder is meant to hold the zcommon ACS files provided by ACC. BCC
provides its own zcommon ACS files, but if you don't want to use them, you can
use the zcommon ACS files provided by ACC. Place the zcommon.acs, zdefs.acs,
zspecial.acs, and zwvars.acs files from the ACC compiler in this folder, then
edit the zcommon.acs file in the parent folder.
